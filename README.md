# Brand Orders

## Overview

Your team is building an admin app to track orders for different brands.

You will be writing React code to display order information, and adding some basic controls for data manipulation.

Use this starting list of brands:

```
[
    {
      name: "Matter",
      orders: [
        {
          date: "2023-01-20T22:11:43.452Z",
          price: 100
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Uncoil",
      orders: [
        {
          date: "2022-07-02T09:21:22.222Z",
          price: 95
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Strawhouse",
      orders: [
        {
          date: "2009-10-31T12:00:01.000Z",
          price: 51
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```
